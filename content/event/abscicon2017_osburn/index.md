abstract: "**Motivation:** Earth’s deep subsurface hosts a diverse microbiome rich in potential for the study of
conditions analogous to exoplanetary interiors and
corresponding microbial intraterrestrials. Access to the
subsurface is often transient, however, and involves
major disruptions to the very environments we seek to
study. To overcome these challenges we have established a network of six packered boreholes that serve
as stable sampling ports at the Sanford Underground
Research Facility (SURF), South Dakota, USA. Our
network extends from 250-1500 m below the surface,
allowing access to deep subsurface fluids across a
large range of ages and compositions. By tapping these
directly, we are poised to install long-term experimental apparatus and conduct targeted experiments to
further characterize the ecology and physiology of
Earth’s deepest inhabitants.
<br><br>
**Methods:** The deep subsurface of SURF has been
previously shown to contain diverse microbial life and
geochemical potential [1, 2]. We selected the DeMMO
sites from a subset of previously-studied boreholes
while including two new sites, at 610 m and 1250 m, to
provide additional coverage across the depth gradient.
Each site exhibits consistent water outflow rates, limited evidence for subsurface interaction with mine
workings, and is regularly accessible. We capped each
borehole using custom designed and machined expandable packers composed of high-density plastic
(Delrin) and polyurethane rather than the standard
stainless steel manifolds because these latter corrode
rapidly in the subsurface, affecting both their lifespan
and the geochemical integrity of the associated waters,
thereby also affecting native microbial community
structure. Prior to packering, boreholes were drilled out
and reamed to remove old concrete plugs and create a
stable surface against which the packers could seal.
Drilling and packer installation was carried out at 3 of
6 DeMMO holes (DeMMO 3, 4, and 5) from May to
July 2016. Geochemical and microbiological monitoring of fluids from each site began prior to hole modification and has continued since on an approximately
bimonthy basis. Analyses include major cations and
anions, redox sensitive solutes (DO, Fe2+, NO3
-
, NH4
+
,
S2-
), DIC, DOC, dissolved gas composition, water isotopes, and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes of cells filtered from borehole fluids.
<br><br>
**Results:** Continued monitoring of DeMMO boreholes from December 2015 to December 2016 has
identified each site as a unique and stable biogeochemical island.
<br><br>
Geochemistry. Geochemical data reveal consistent
fluid compositions at individual stations. Similar compositions of nonreactive ions between sets of boreholes
suggest that each pair of sites is hydrologically connected. This observation is consistent with the spatial
orientation of the boreholes and expected hydrologic
flow paths. There is no apparent seasonal trend in either flow rate or major element chemistry, consistent
with the long residence time of these fluids in the subsurface. A gradient of decreasing DOC with depth is
consistent with the gradual consumption of surfacederived organic matter by native microbes.
<br><br>
*Microbiology.* DNA sequencing of borehole fluids
revealed significant microbial diversity within the
SURF site as well as substantial differences between
boreholes. Drilling was found to impart a significant
but transient perturbation to the microbial community
in a particular borehole. Holes that were not subjected
to drilling display a remarkably consistent community
composition over the course of months. Significant
populations of candidate phyla (e.g. OP3) and deeply
divergent strains of known phyla are present at most
sites. Of the sequences from characterized phyla, those
most closely related to microbes involved in sulfur and
iron cycling are well-represented as are relatives of
known thermophiles. Continued monitoring of all sites
will allow us to evaluate the longer-term impact of
drilling on the deep subsurface microbiome as well as
further illuminate the connections between geochemistry and microbiology in this unique environment.
<br><br>
Experiments aimed at culturing and characterizing
microbial inhabitants are underway at a number of
DeMMO sites. In particular, we are interested in replicating the intra-fracture biofilm community by cultivating microorganisms on solid substrates using flowthrough columns as well as more traditional approaches using synthetic growth media.
<br><br>
**Future directions:** We aim to establish collaborations at other deep subsurface research sites, most notably in the South African and Canadian Shields, to
establish nodes of DeMMO worldwide.
