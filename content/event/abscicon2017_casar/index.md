abstract: "**Introduction:** Understanding the diverse physiology, ecology, and metabolic characteristics of microbial
life in terrestrial subsurface environments is a critical
step in the search for extraterrestrial examples. The
subsurface offers protection from environmental
stressors (i.e. extreme temperatures and radiation) that
may exist on the surface of extraterrestrial bodies, and
has the potential both for liquid water [1] and fuel for
lithotrophic metabolisms [2]. Furthermore, biofilms
that colonize fluid-filled fractures create microenvironments that aid survival under otherwise extreme
conditions. These communities may represent a significant fraction of subsurface life [3]. To better understand these systems, we characterize rock-hosted biofilm communities from a deep, iron and sulfur-rich
Mars analogue site. 
<br><br>
The Sanford Underground Research Facility
(SURF) is located at the former Homestake gold mine
in Lead, South Dakota. The mine is currently accessible to a depth of 1,480 meters. Legacy boreholes intersecting fluid-filled fractures provide access to deep
fluids that host lithotrophic microbial life [4]. Geochemical analyses show these fluids to be somewhat heterogeneous, with locally high concentrations of
ammonia, nitrate, sulfide, sulfate, iron, and manganese.
The geochemistry of these fluids ranges from oxidizing
to highly reducing, with pH neutral to slightly alkaline
and temperatures from 10-30 ˚C.
<br><br>
While planktonic microbial communities within
borehole fluids have been previously described [4];
biofilm communities within these fractures have yet to
be characterized. Here we describe a novel approach to
culturing interstitial biofilms in situ using artificial
substrates. In addition, we present the results of ongoing efforts to isolate and describe the metabolic capabilities of novel organisms in the laboratory, specifically those capable of respiring ferric oxide minerals.
<br><br>
**Field Experiments:** Sampling borehole fluids by
filtering suspended cells captures only planktonic
members of the microbial community, which may be
only a small fraction of the deep subsurface microbiome [3]. We therefore designed flow-through samplers
to target the attached communities and mitigate bias
introduced by laboratory cultivation from fluid samples. Borehole fluids were directed into gas-tight glass
cartridges filled with sterilized sand, Pyrex beads, and
glass wool. Fluids exiting the cartridges flowed over a
set of glass slides exposed to the mine atmosphere.
Biofilms grown on these substrates can then be directly
characterized using a broad array of analytical techniques including metagenomics, microscopy, C/N ratios, lipid extraction and profiling, and Raman spectroscopy. In doing so, we can link the community composition of the biofilms with associated mineral assemblages, microstructure, and biosignature composition
as well as the geochemistry of the associated borehole
fluids. A second array of cartridges filled with hematite, pyrite, and magnetite will be deployed in February
2017 to enrich for iron and sulfur-associated biofilms.
<br><br>
Preliminary observations indicate geochemical
controls on biofilm formation, as black (likely reduced) biofilms within cartridges transitioned to red
biofilms in the cartridge outflow under the oxygenated
mine atmosphere. The thickest accumulations of biofilms were formed on glass wool cartridges, indicating
surface textural controls on biofilm formation. Whole
community δ13C values of biofilms suggest both organic and inorganic carbon are incorporated into microbial biomass.
<br><br>
**Lab Experiments:** Many of the 16S rRNA gene
sequences obtained from SURF have no closelyrelated relatives among organisms that have been previously isolated [4]. We attempt to shed light on the
metabolic roles of these uncultivated organisms by
using media designed to mimic in situ geochemical
conditions. Abundant iron oxides are available at
SURF; however, these insoluble substrates require
specialized metabolic strategies. Batch cultivation experiments targeting anaerobic, heterotrophic and autotrophic iron reducers were inoculated with fluids collected from depths of 610 and 1,480 meters. Ferrihydrite, organic carbon, and hydrogen served as electron
acceptors and donors. Isolate characterization includes
microscopy and DNA sequencing to determine cell
morphology, microbe-mineral associations, and taxonomy. Additional experiments will employ biofilms
collected from field experiments as inocula.
<br><br>
Preliminary results indicate SURF microorganisms
are capable of reducing ferric iron minerals. However,
whether the iron is being actively or passively reduced
remains unclear. Precipitates formed on glass walls of
culture tubes are strikingly similar to those observed in
cartridge experiments.
