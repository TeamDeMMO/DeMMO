We culture microbes collected from DeMMO under controlled laboratory conditions. Through our culture experiments, we are able to characterize metabolic function in DeMMO communities. We are working to isolate important members of the communities so that we can describe their specific roles in detail. This work requires specialized equipment because the fracture fluids are anoxic. We use an anaerobic Coy chamber and mix our own gases with a custom-built gas manifold.

Our experiments target both microbes suspended in fluids and in biofilms. The image below shows continuous flow experiments targeting DeMMO biofilms on native host rock.
